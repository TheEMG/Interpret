# Interpret
The purpose of this program is to learn the fundamentals of how a computer interprets and executes instructions. This is done by creating a simulation that handles arithmetic operations, memory management between registers, and instruction execution.
The program reads from a file a set of instructions and outputs the final state of the registers and the total number of instructions executed. 


## What I Learned
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): The fundamental concepts of how computers interpret and execute instructions based on opcode and operands.
- Memory Management: The significance of efficiently managing memory, both in terms of registers and the larger memory space, and how instructions manipulate these spaces.
- Control Flow: How computers use instructions to make decisions, jump to different instructions, and halt execution.
